This section contains the maintenance guide for the M5Stack devices, and all the items it will
contain on the track. Along with, troubleshooting to ensure that everything will run smoothly as it
should, making sure we are pushing the code correctly onto the M5stack Devices. Lastly, making
sure what tools and materials needed for the command center and how are we gone approach. 

Maintenance
o To ensure proper functionality, it is best to reburn the program onto the M5Stack
every month. If hiccups occur, make sure to try this methodology first before
tampering with any sensors/placement.

• Track Setup
o To set up the track, admin should ensure that each M5Stack is in its proper
location on the map. The set up of M5Stacks is as follows:
? Rover M5:
• Area labeled “START”
• M5 Go, Laptop, Phone or Tablet
• 2x 360 Servo
• 1x Clamp unit
• Running M5RemoteServo.m5f
? Toxic Waste M5:
• Middle of hazard area
• M5 Go
• 2x Ultrasonic Sensor
• Running RadioactiveWasteSensor.m5f
? Main Screen M5Stack
• In the area marked “MAIN SCREEN”
• M5Stack Core 2
• 1x PIR Sensor
• Running MainScreen.m5f
? Numpad Puzzle M5Stack
• In the area marked “NUMPAD PUZZLE”
• M5Stack Core 2
• 1x 180 Servo
• Running Numpad.m5f
o After Each M5Stack is running its proper code, the next step is to ensure that the
M5Stacks are properly charged. To ensure this is being done, it is recommended
that the M5Stacks be plugged in via USB whenever possible as they do not have
long battery lives.

• Payload
o After every run, ensure that the payload is returned to the proper location for the
next user
o Also ensure no damage has occurred to the payload and replace if necessary.

• Troubleshooting
o Battery Issues
? Battery life is extremely low for these devices
? As such, ensure that the devices are plugged in via USB whenever
downtime is possible
? If all else fails, try pushing the code back onto the M5Stack with its
respective code
• See Pushing Code Issues if problems arise here

o Pushing Code Issues
? Ensure the M5 has both a green Wi-Fi symbol AND a green cloud symbol
• If not, ensure that the M5Stack is connected to the proper Wi-Fi
SSID
• This can be accomplished by heading into Wi-Fi Config on Core 2
and Setup on M5 Go
• Follow instructions on M5Stack
• NOTE: You can also set up the proper SSID and password upon
burning a version of UI Flow via M5Burner program
? If both symbols are green but you cannot push the code via the online
version of UI Flow:
• Refresh the connection between the M5Stack and UI Flow
• Ensure that the M5Stack is running a compatible version of UI
Flow
o Ex: If you try to push the Rover code to the M5 Go using
the desktop version of UI Flow, it will not push even if all
conditions are met for a proper connection. This is due to
the desktop version of UI Flow not containing the logic to
execute the remote via QR code.

o Sensor Connectivity Issues
? Ensure that the sensors are connected to the correct ports as they are
declared within the code in UI Flow:
• Ultrasonic Sensors: Port B and Port A
• 360 Servos: Port B and Port C
• Clamp Unit: Port A
• 180 Servo: Port A
? Ensure that the code is running properly by pushing the code to the unit
again
? Ensure that there is a solid connection between the sensor and the
M5Stack
? Ensure that all port connections are straight/there
? If all else fails, try replacing sensor with another of the same type

o Pi Server Connectivity Issues
? If no connection is being made between the M5Stack and the Eve
RESTful Service:
• Ensure that HTTP Post code is being sent to the correct IP
address/port
o You can check this by typing ifconfig in a command
prompt on the raspberry pi
• Ensure that the EVE RESTful Service is initiated on the PI
o Run the python3 script titled “CommandCenterLogs.py”
• Ensure that all versions of packages are the correct ones for this
specific context
• Ensure that both the M5Stack and Pi are connected to the same
network
o NOTE: 5GHz and 2.4 GHz connections are technically
different, even if they are coming from the same router.
They WILL NOT see each other if one is on 5G, and the
other is not.
o Internet Connectivity Issues
? To ensure that M5 device is on the same network as the Phone or Tablet
when you are using the M5Remote.

• Command Center Operations
o User will require:
? 1x Raspberry Pi Unit (running Legacy Debian 32 bit)
? PyMongo
? MongoDB
? EVE RESTful service
? 1x monitor
? 1x keyboard
? 1x mouse
o User will pull the GitHub repo for the command center onto the Raspberry Pi
o Run the Python3 code entitled “CommandCenterLogs.py” via Command Line
o Once this is running, your server is good to go!
o Now any information sent via the puzzles will be stored here within the
MongoDB
o This will be used by the Command Center GUI, which will display what is going
on and the status of each puzzle
